The Boom
Palaye Royale
Let's suppose that you were able, every night
To dream any dream you wanted to dream
And that you could, for example, have the power, within one night
To dream seventy-five years of time
Or any length of time you wanted to have
And you would, naturally, as you began on this adventure of dreams
You would fulfill all your wishes
You would have every kind of pleasure you could conceive.
Then you would get more and more adventurous
And you would make further and further out gambles
As to what you could dream
Finally, you would dream where you are now
You would dream the dream of living the life you are actually living today
That would be within the infinite multiplicity of choices of dreams you would have
Of playing that you weren't God
